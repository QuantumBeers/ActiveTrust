# ActiveTrust

**Trust, how it’s meant to be.**  
A protocol for presence, a framework for consent, and a new foundation for access.

---

## What is ActiveTrust?

ActiveTrust is a lightweight, self-sovereign protocol for **signing intent**, **verifying consent**, and **enabling access** based on real-world alignment—not static roles.

It redefines trust as something **you co-create**, not something granted to you.

Whether you're:
- Sharing a simulation  
- Issuing access to a dataset  
- Mutually consenting to something sacred  

**ActiveTrust captures the moment, signs it, and stores it with integrity.**

> It's **verifiable** but **private**.  
> **Immutable** but **contextual**.  
> **Human-first**, always.

---

## Use ActiveTrust to:
- Prove presence without revealing identity  
- Co-sign agreements that only become readable with shared consent  
- Automatically grant access based on interaction, not credentials  
- Anchor meaningful human experiences in structured logic

> **No passwords. No surveillance. Just trust—alive, signed, and sovereign.**

---

## Overview

ActiveTrust is a dynamic trust access protocol rooted in:
- **Relational intelligence**
- **Contextual presence**
- **Signed intent**

It connects users to systems not just by *who they are*, but by **how they show up**.

## The Stack

This protocol is natively designed to integrate with the systems I've built:

### 1. Dust5D  
Trust relationships flow like time—across relational dimensions.  
ActiveTrust anchors temporal interactions using **context-aware identity references** in Dust5D’s graph memory layer.

---

### 2. Banano Wallet MFA  
Every request is a signed message.  
No passwords. No secrets.  
Just **presence, proof, and propagation**.

- Wallet address = identity hash  
- Signed message = trust handshake  
- Transactional activity = behavioral validation

---

### 3. Dynamic Identity Graphs (Access Control Lists)  
Roles are not fixed.  
They emerge from the **shape of interaction**.

Trust levels adapt based on:
- **Enterprise-grade fine-grained access control out of the box**
- Frequency of signed interactions  
- Co-signed context (e.g. shared projects)  
- Confirmation by trusted peers  

---

### 4. Relational Trust Fabric  
This is a **fabric**, not a firewall.  
Trust is mapped as a multi-dimensional graph of:
- Individual intent  
- Shared purpose  
- Proven presence  

> Node-to-node interactions are logged as **cryptographically verifiable links** in the trust lattice.

---

## Enterprise Integration

ActiveTrust isn’t just for individuals—it **scales**.

It’s designed to extend across **enterprise access vectors**, integrating with existing platforms like:
- Third-Party Trust Validation (Contracts/Settlements/Audit Tracking)
- Azure AD / Okta / IAM providers  
- Cloud resource tagging policies  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Instead of static policies, **ActiveTrust introduces identity as a contextual interface**.  
Access isn’t pre-defined—it’s **negotiated, signed, and verifiable**.

### Use ActiveTrust to:
- Bridge decentralized identity into existing infrastructure  
- Log signed events into existing audit chains  
- Trigger enterprise automations only when presence and co-signature requirements are met  

> **From:** “Who has permission?”  
> **To:** “Who was here, and what was the agreement in that moment?”

## Identity Principles

* **Sovereignty First**
  You own your access. You decide your exposure.

* **Proof Over Profile**
  What you prove in presence matters more than your static credentials.

* **Alignment Over Authority**
  Access is granted by coherence, not hierarchy.

## Coming Soon

* Wallet co-signature coordination
* Cross-domain wallet relays
* Dust5D identity relink with ribbon-based TTL
* UI module for AccessGraph™ traceability
