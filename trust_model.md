 Co-Sign or Bounce: The Trust Architecture Behind ActiveTrust

## Introduction
ActiveTrust is more than a protocol.  
It’s a new way of relating to systems—**rooted in consent, not control.**

This document expands on the core trust model that underpins the protocol:  
**Co-Sign or Bounce** vs. **Allow or Deny.**

## Trust Models in Access Systems

| **Model**           | **Premise**             | **Mechanism**                 | **Outcome**          | **Trust Type**         |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Allow / Deny        | Authority decides         | Policy-based gatekeeping      | Binary: Yes or No     | Imposed / Static        |
| Co-Sign / Bounce    | Alignment decides         | Mutual cryptographic consent  | Mutual: In or Out     | Emergent / Contextual   |

## The Problem with Allow / Deny

- Relies on **predefined roles**, not real-time context  
- Ignores nuance of **relational trust**  
- Offers no **proof of consent**—only rule-checking  
- Lacks **human presence** and **adaptive logic**

---

## The Promise of Co-Sign / Bounce

- Identity is not assumed—it’s **presented and accepted**  
- Every transaction is **signed by both parties**  
- Consent becomes **traceable, verifiable, and portable**  
- System architecture favors **relational coherence over hierarchy**

---

## Why This Matters for ActiveTrust

- Reduces surface area for **coercion, manipulation, and false access**  
- Encourages systems to **respond to intent**, not just credentials  
- Establishes trust as a **living layer**, not a static config

> “You don’t get access because you passed a gate.  
> You get access because **presence matched the shape.**”

## What Comes Next

- Presence-Based TTL Tokens  
- AccessGraph™ Relational Tracing  
- Multi-party Contextual Signing  
- Enterprise Bridge Layers *(RBAC → Relational ACL)*

**This is the future of access:  
Relational. Sovereign. Alive.**
